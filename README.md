# Code Challenge: Bot Battlr

## Learning Goals

- Implement a mini web app to practice on components, props, state, events and data fetching in react

## Introduction

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of bots, among other features. 
Welcome to **Bot Battlr**, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army!

## Project Setup & Pre-requisite Data

In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/157IfYxr4Bp63-ByF1g1wCP1uOpQ5i2R4/view). for your server DB.
Run this command to get the backend started: `**json-server --watch db.json**`
Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:8001/bots

### Technologies

* JSX
* CSS
* JSON
* HTML

## Project Guidelines

Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

### Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.

### Bonus Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking
  on the card should instead display a show view (`BotSpecs`) for that bot,
  which should replace `BotsCollection`. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one
  to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot.
- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
- When I enlist a bot it will be **removed** from the `BotCollection` and added
  to `YourBotArmy`.
- Filter bots by their class. We can select a few filters at the same time.
- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
- Only enlist **one** bot from each `bot_class`. The classes are
  `["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"]`
